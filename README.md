# CryptoClustering

## Citations

- Utilized much of classwork examples to write code. Code was very similar to what is displayed. Mainly used activities from day 2 activities 2,3, and 4 as well as day 3 activity 2.

- hvplot code wouldn't always work so I provided matplotlib equivalent underneath. Not all matplotlib plots are as interactive/work the exact same, but the hvplot code should work/be the correct code.

- Looked up how to composite plot online in [hvplot documentation](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Viewing.html). Allowed me to plot elbow plots and cluster plots side by side:
